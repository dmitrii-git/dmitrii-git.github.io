# 🎛️ Git Commander  
### A Retro‑Styled GitHub Explorer Inspired by Norton Commander

Git Commander is a keyboard‑driven, two‑panel GitHub explorer built in pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
It recreates the nostalgic feel of classic file managers while letting you browse any GitHub user's repositories and file structures in real time.
